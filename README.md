<h1 align="center">Fullstack Ideabox (Frontend)</h1>

## Abstract
Frontend side of a little ideabox application with minimal design to be used in conjunction with [Backend Ideabox](https://github.com/danielcurtin/be-ideabox) as a first step into fullstack development.

## Installation
`clone` this directory<br>
`cd fe-ideabox`<br>
`npm i` to install dependencies<br>
`npm start` to run the server<br>
and it should open up right into your default browser at `localhost:3000`<br>
note: The app will not function without the backend also running, which can be found [here](https://github.com/danielcurtin/be-ideabox)

## Context
Created as a (successful!) attempt at creating a fullstack application, and to give the backend some more life than just Postman.
